# A STUDENT SCORE CALCULATOR

A Python program that calculates and reports student scores using advanced function parameters such as *args, **kwargs, argument unpacking, and variable scope.
This project is designed to demonstrate flexible function design and clean reporting of results.

## FEATURES

- Accepts any number of student scores using *args.
- Supports optional configuration settings using **kwargs (weight, bonus, pass mark).
- Uses list/tuple unpacking and dictionary unpacking when calling functions.
- Calculates average, weighted score, and final result.
- Determines PASS or FAIL status.
- Demonstrates global and local variable scope.
- Produces a formatted student score report.

## HOW IT WORKS
- Already has a default student score.

## REUIRED LIBRARIES
